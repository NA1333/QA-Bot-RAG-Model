## Working of the RAG Model QA Bot
1. Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a Question Answering (QA) bot that leverages both retrieval and generative techniques to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries based on uploaded documents.

2. Key Components
The project is built using several components that work together:

Embedding Model:

A Sentence Transformer model is employed to convert text documents and user queries into dense vector embeddings, capturing their semantic meaning.
Vector Database:

Pinecone is used to store and manage the document embeddings. It enables efficient similarity searches to retrieve relevant documents based on user queries.
Generative Model:

A language model, such as Cohere, is used to generate natural language responses based on the context provided by the retrieved documents.
3. Workflow of the QA Bot
Step 1: Document Upload
Users can upload PDF documents to the application. The bot processes these documents to extract their text content.
Step 2: Text Extraction
The application uses a library like PyPDF2 to read the uploaded PDF file and extract the text. This text is the content that will be referenced during the question-answering process.
Step 3: Embedding Generation
The extracted text is fed into the Sentence Transformer model to generate embeddings. Each document is transformed into a high-dimensional vector that represents its semantic meaning.
Step 4: Indexing in Pinecone
The generated embeddings are stored in Pinecone. Each embedding is indexed to facilitate quick retrieval during query processing.
Step 5: User Query
Users can input their questions into the application. The input question is also converted into an embedding using the same Sentence Transformer model.
Step 6: Document Retrieval
The bot performs a similarity search in Pinecone using the embedded user query. It retrieves the most relevant document embeddings based on cosine similarity.
Step 7: Context Creation
The relevant document texts are collected and combined to form a context for the answer generation. This context provides the necessary information for generating a meaningful response.
Step 8: Generative Response
The combined context and user question are structured into a prompt for the Cohere model. The prompt follows this format:

#### 
Context: <retrieved document text>
Question: <user question>
Answer:
The Cohere model processes the prompt and generates a coherent and contextually relevant answer.
Step 9: Output
The generated answer is displayed to the user as the bot's response to their query.
4. Conclusion
The RAG model combines the strengths of retrieval (finding relevant information) and generation (creating coherent text) to deliver accurate answers. This approach allows the QA bot to leverage large volumes of document data while maintaining a natural and engaging user experience.
